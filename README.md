# Stats
Stats/Analytics generator for IRC and Slack channels

### Demos
* [Aligned Pixels, Ink. üèá](https://kash.im/stats/aligned.html) (Slack group, four channels)
* [Designer Network](https://kash.im/stats/dn.html) (IRC channel)
* [Spec.fm](https://kash.im/stats/spec.html) (Slack group, one channel, no avatars)

### Usage

This script assumes your logs are formatted like so

```
[2006-01-02 15:04:05 -0700] <joebloggs> This is a message
[2006-01-02 15:04:05 -0700] * joebloggs is preforming an action
```

#### Basic usage

Edit `config.yaml` and set `:location`to your log file, then run `stats.rb`. This will create a `database.json` and `stats.html` in the script directoy.
